# COMPONENTS

This directory contains your Components.

The `components/` directory is where you put all your Vue components which can then be imported inside your pages or other components [(learn more)](https://vuejs.org/guide/essentials/component-basics.html#components-basics).

Nuxt automatically imports any components in your `components/` directory (along with components that are registered by any modules you may be using).

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/guide/directory-structure/components).
